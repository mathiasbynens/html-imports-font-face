> Why does `@font-face` work as expected on <https://mathiasbynens.github.io/html-imports-font-face/standalone.html> but not on <https://mathiasbynens.github.io/html-imports-font-face/example.html>?

> `@font-face` doesn’t seem to work from within HTML imports, but I don’t know why. Does any spec mandate this, or is this an implementation bug that just happens to be present in both Chromium and Gecko? Or am I doing something very wrong here?
